# Github Favorites

## Description of the project.

This project is a simple example of a web application that allows users to add and remove their favorite Github profiles.

The application was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and leverages the Github API to retrieve profile information. The project utilizes various JavaScript features, including fetch, async, and await, to make API requests and manipulate data.

Users can add Github profiles by entering a username into the search bar and clicking "Add". The application then retrieves the user's profile information and displays it on the page, including their profile picture, bio, and list of repositories. Users can also remove profiles by clicking the "Remove" button next to the profile.

The project is a good example of using modern JavaScript features to build a functional web application. It also demonstrates how to interact with external APIs using the fetch method and how to work with asynchronous functions using async and await.

## Usage
To use the application, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser. No additional dependencies or setup are required.
